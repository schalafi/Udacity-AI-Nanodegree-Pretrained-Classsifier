Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  The tree models classify my dog as a golden retriever.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three got the correct breed (golden retriever) for both images.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: the three models identify the animal and the object as not a dog. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I found the three models struggle with the images I uploaded, neither identify correctely the Caracal and the Balck Hole.
I know these are animals/objects unknow for the models, thus is normal they are unable to predict correclty the animal/object.
At least for the Caracal the models get close enough, identifying it as a feline.

I consider the best model to be alexnet model, in terms of time efficiency, it is the best, aslo was capable to achieve similar results compared with VGG and ResNet.
